I am a researcher and machine learning engineer at Google Research working to build the next generation of sustainable solutions for agriculture. I am motivated by the potential of technology to solve the world's most pressing challenges to create a positive impact for everyone, particularly in the areas of health, education and sustainability. 

Previously, I have worked at Google Scholar using AI to make quality research more accessible to everyone, and at Google Medical Brain in collaboration with clinicians to collect, label, and curate training data for a diverse range of AI projects in medicine. 

I received a dual bachelor's degree in Math and Computer Science and a master's degree with a concentration in AI from Stanford University. My academic research was conducted in the Stanford Vision Lab advised by Prof. Fei-Fei Li and Prof. Juan Carlos Niebles in conjunction with the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory under the guidance of Prof. Ehsan Adeli and Prof. Kilian Pohl. My research projects have focused on using computer vision to develop systems for Parkinson's disease assessment and developing statistical techniques to reduce the effect of confounding variables on ML models.
